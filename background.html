            <h2>Defence in Depth</h2>
            <p>The importance of computer forensics to a business or a corporation is of paramount importance. For instance, 
                there is often the thinking that simply fortifying the lines of defense with firewalls, routers, etc. will be 
                enough to thwart off any Cyber-attack. To the security professional, he or she knows that this is untrue, given 
                the extremely sophisticated nature of today’s Cyber hacker.</p>

            <p>This premise is also untrue from the standpoint of computer forensics. While these specialized pieces of hardware 
                do provide information to a certain degree as to what generally transpired during a Cyber-attack, they very often 
                do not possess that deeper layer of data to provide those clues as to what exactly happened.             
                This underscores the need for the organization also to implement those security mechanisms 
                (along with hardware above) which can provide these specific pieces of data (examples of this include 
                those security devices which make use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, business analytics, etc.).             
                Thus, deploying this kind of security model in which the principles of computer forensics are also adopted is 
                also referred to as <span class="highlight">“Defense in Depth.”</span>           
                By having these specific pieces of data, there is a much greater probability that the evidence presented 
                will be considered as admissible in a court of law, thus bringing the perpetrators who launched Cyber-attack to 
                justice.</p>

        <h2>Objectives of Computer Forensics</h2>
            <p>Here are the essential objectives of using Computer forensics:</p>    
            <ul>
                <li>It helps to recover, analyze, and preserve computer and related materials in such a manner that it 
                    helps the investigation agency to present them as evidence in a court of law.</li>
                <li>It helps to postulate the motive behind the crime and identity of the main culprit.</li>
                <li>Designing procedures at a suspected crime scene which helps you to ensure that the digital evidence obtained is not corrupted.</li>    
                <li>Data acquisition and duplication: Recovering deleted files and deleted partitions from digital media to 
                    extract the evidence and validate them.</li>
