                    <h2>Types</h2>
                    <p>The various types of Digital Forensics are:</p>
                    <h4>Disk Forensics</h4>
                    <p>It deals with extracting data from storage media by searching active, modified, or deleted files.</p>
                <h4>Network Forensics</h4>
                <p>It is a sub-branch of digital forensics. It is 
                related to monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic to collect important information and legal evidence.</p> 
                <h4>Malware Forensics</h4>
                <p>This branch deals with the identification of malicious code, to study their payload, viruses, worms, etc.</p> 
                <h4>Email Forensics</h4>
                <p>Deals with recovery and analysis of emails, including deleted emails, calendars, and contacts.</p>   
                <h4>Memory Forensics</h4>
                <p>It deals with collecting data from system memory (system registers, cache, RAM) in raw form and then 
                    carving the data from Raw dump.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Phone Forensics</h4>
                <p>It mainly deals with the examination and analysis of mobile devices. It helps to retrieve phone and SIM contacts, 
                call logs, incoming, and outgoing SMS/MMS, Audio, videos, etc</p>  
                <h4>Tools</h4>  
                <p>The computer is a reliable witness that cannot lie. Digital evidence contains an unfiltered account of a 
                    suspect’s activity, recorded in his or her direct words and actions.Previously, we had many computer 
                    forensic tools that were used to apply forensic techniques to the computer. However, we have listed few best forensic tools 
                    that are promising for today’s computers:</p>
