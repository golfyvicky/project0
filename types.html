            <h3>Network Forensics</h3>
            <p>It is a sub-branch of digital forensics. It is 
                related to monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic to collect important information and legal evidence.</p> 
            <h3>Malware Forensics</h3>

                suspect’s activity, recorded in his or her direct words and actions.Previously, we had many computer 
                forensic tools that were used to apply forensic techniques to the computer. However, we have listed few best forensic tools 
                that are promising for today’s computers:</p>
