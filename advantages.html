            <p>Some of the major advantages of Digital Forensics are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To ensure the integrity of the computer system.</li>
                    <li>To produce evidence in the court, which can lead to the punishment of the culprit.</li>
                    <li>It helps the companies to capture important information if their computer systems or networks are compromised.</li>
                    <li>Efficiently tracks down cybercriminals from anywhere in the world.</li>
                    <li>Helps to protect the organization's money and valuable time.</li>

                    <li>Easy availability of hacking tools</li>
                    <li>Lack of physical evidence makes prosecution difficult.</li>
                    <li>The large amount of storage space into Terabytes that makes this investigation job difficult.</li>
                    <li>Any technological changes require an upgrade or changes to solutions.</li>
