            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>The term forensics literally means using some sort of established scientific process for the collection, 
                analysis, and presentation of the evidence which has been collected. However, all forms of evidence are important,
                 especially when a Cyber-attack has occurred. Thus, a formal definition of computer forensics can be presented 
                 as follows: </p>
            <p>“It is the discipline that combines the elements of <span class="highlight">law and computer science</span> to collect and analyze data 
                from computer systems, networks, wireless communications and storage devices in a way that is <span class="highlight">admissible 
                    as evidence in a court of law.</span>” </p>
            <h2>Importance of Computer Forensics</h2>  
            <p>When a Cyber-attack has occurred, collecting all relevant evidence is of utmost importance to answer the 
                questions which were outlined in above. However, keep in mind that the forensics examiner/investigator is 
                particularly interested in a particular piece of evidence, which is known specifically as “latent data.”
                In the Cybersecurity world, this kind of data (also known as “ambient data”) is not easily seen or accessible 
                upon first glance at the scene of a Cyber-attack. In other words, it takes a much deeper level of investigation 
                by the computer forensics expert to unearth them. Obviously, this data has many uses to it, but it was 
                implemented in such a way that access to it has been extremely limited. </p>     
                <p>Examples of latent or ambient data are as follows:-</p>   
                <ol>
                    <li>Information which is in computer storage but is not readily referenced in the file allocation tables;</li>
                    <li>Information which cannot be viewed readily by the operating system or commonly used software applications;</li>
                    <li>Data which has been purposely deleted and is now located in:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unallocated spaces in the hard drive;</li>
                            <li>Swap files;</li>
                            <li>Memory Dumps</li>
                            <li>Print Spooler files;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
